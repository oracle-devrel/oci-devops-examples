## Introduction

Rapid delivery of software is essential for efficiently running your applications in the cloud. Oracle DevOps service provides a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform for developers. You can use the OCI DevOps service to easily build, test, and deploy software and applications on Oracle Cloud. DevOps build and deployment pipelines reduce change-driven errors and decrease the time customers spend on building and deploying releases.

The service also provides private Git repositories to store your code and it supports connections to external code repositories. Whether you're migrating workloads to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)—from on-premises or other clouds—or developing new applications on OCI, you can use the DevOps service to simplify your software delivery lifecycle.
