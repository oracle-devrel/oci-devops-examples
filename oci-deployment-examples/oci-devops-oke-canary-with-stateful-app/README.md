An illustration of OCI Deployment Canary strategy with a stateful application.---Context-------- The illustration provides a deployment flow of a sample application with a stateful data source shared across .- The deployment follows [OCI Canary Deployment strategy model](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/plan-mad-strats-devops/understand-depoyment-architectures.html#GUID-1E607CF8-3446-476F-9372-355937F209ED).- Objective here to ensure backend data consistency across canary and production stages (with in the same stateful data source).- Here the focus is only for OCI Deployment pipeline ,but the same can be integrated along with other OCI devops services as well (Build, Code repo etc)![](images/oci_context.png)Application topology---- Sample application build using Guestbook app - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/- Stateful database is build using redis - inspired by blog by Okteto -  https://www.okteto.com/blog/connect-applications-across-namespaces/- We will be using Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) for application deployment.Specific instructions to download only this example .---```    $ git init oci-devops-oke-canary-with-stateful-app    $ cd oci-devops-deploy-with-canary-model-oke    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-devops-examples    $ git config core.sparsecheckout true    $ echo "oci-deployment-examples/oci-devops-oke-canary-with-stateful-app/*">>.git/info/sparse-checkout    $ git pull --depth=1 origin main```Procedure---- Create an OCI Dynamic group and add below rules.```ALL {resource.type = 'devopsdeploypipeline', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.xxxx'}```- Create an OCI Policy as below.```Allow dynamic-group <DG NAME> to manage repos in compartment <COMPARTMENT NAME>Allow dynamic-group <DG NAME> to manage generic-artifacts in compartment <COMPARTMENT NAME>Allow dynamic-group <DG NAME> to use ons-topics in compartment <COMPARTMENT NAME>Allow dynamic-group <DG NAME> to read all-artifacts in compartment <COMPARTMENT NAME>Allow dynamic-group <DG NAME> to manage cluster-family in compartment <COMPARTMENT NAME>```- Create an OCI Container registry repo (enable as public repo ) -

https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/create_oke_environment.htm  ![](images/oci_devops_env.png)- Create an OCI devops artifact with type 'Kubernetes manifest' and store the artifacts from file [guestbook_app.yaml](appConfig/guestbook_app.yml)![](images/oci_artifact_guestbook.png)- Create another  OCI devops artifact with type 'Kubernetes manifest' and store the artifacts from file [redis.yaml](appConfig/redis.yml)![](images/oci_artifact_redis.png)- Create an OCI deployment pipeline for the Redis DB deployment.- With in the deployment pipeline add a deployment stage as type `Apply manifest to Your Kubernetes`![](images/oci_deploy_stagea.png)- Associate with the `OKE devops environment` and `Redis.yaml` artifact . Use the namespace as `ns-prod` to deploy the DB under production namespace.![](images/oci_deploy_stage_redis.png)- Create another OCI devops deployment pipeline for the application with Canary deployment.- Use 'Canary Strategy' as the stage type.![](images/oci_canary_stage.png)- Select the deployment type as OKE , use `ns-canary` as canary namespace and `ns-prod` for production namespace.- Associate it with the guest book artifacts created.  ![](images/oci_oke_canary_1.png)- Use `guestbook-ingress` as the NGINX ingress name.- Use ramp limit as 25% under canary shift so that 25 % of traffic will be served via the new version.![](images/oci_oke_canary_2.png)- You may skip the validation step and add at least one as approval count .![](images/oci_oke_canary_3.png)![](images/oci_oke_canary_4.png)- The final view of deployment pipeline is as below .![](images/oci_deploymentpipeline_guestbook.png)- Let us do the db deployment , to do so ,use the `redis db` pipeline created and execute it via `Run pipeline  option.![](images/oci_redis_dbdeployment.png)- Wait for all the steps to complete .![](images/oci_redis_deploy_steps.png)- Validate the redis deployment using `kubectl` over cloudshell .```markdown$ kubectl get all -n ns-prod |grep -i redis$ kubectl logs -n ns-prod pod/redis-0```![](images/oci_kubectl_redis.png)- Switch to the deployment pipeline created for guestbook.- Add two deployment parameters as below```markdown- "version" with no default value ,its the docker image version that will be used .- "redis_hosts" with default value as redis.ns-prod.svc.cluster.local ,its the service endpoint to access the redis db. ```![](images/oci_deploy_param.png)- Do a manual run of the guestbook deployment pipeline with image version as `v0`.![](images/oci_deploy_guestbook1.png)- Since its the first deployment  we won't be seeing any canary shift as it needs ingress controller to be established (at least one time) with in the namespaces.- So approve the stage and complete until the last step for the deployment.> :Info: ** Specific note on First Deployment using Canary modelWhen the user first do a deployment to the canary namespace, the website will not show up because the main ingress resource is not set up. Nevertheless, the user can still use the port-forwarding command to validate the webpage in the canary namespace. kubectl port-forward svc/guestbook 8080 -n <namespace> would help for forward the service to a localhost ,its possible only when you use kubectl from a machine where you can port forwarding (Not from OCI Cloud shell)![](images/oci_deploy_approval.png)![](images/oci_deploy_approved.png)- Wait for all the deployment steps to complete .![](images/oci_deployment_all_steps.png)- To validate the application ,switch to `OCI Cloud shell and use Kubectl`.```markdown$ kubectl get all,ing -n ns-prod```![](images/oci_kubectl_geting.png)- Fetch the Ingress public ip and use a browser to view the application .![](images/oci_guestbook_app.png)- Please note you may have a different colour ,which is perfectly ok ,but if you see an error stating `Waiting for DB connection` , recheck your Redis URL and Redis deployment ,as it is unable to connect to the data base- Let us add some data to the application and press submit.![](images/oci_app_data.png)- Switch to the deployment pipeline and make a new deployment using version `v1`![](images/oci_pipeline_v2_run.png)- Once the stage for `Canary traffic shift` is completed ,refresh the browser and view that 25 % of traffic will be via version v2.  ![](images/oci_pipeline_canary_shift_ok.png)- You may disable/clear  the cache of your browser if it’s not appearing after some refresh.![](images/oci_app_v2_canary.png)- As you may see the version is changed to v1 and the data is persisting .Let us add some data to the page again .![](images/oci_app_canary_data.png)- If you refresh you can see that V0 is also existing as the V1 is routed via canary ,with 25 % of traffic to it .- Also the data is always persisting .  ![](images/oci_app_with_canaryv1_prod_v0.png)- Switch to the deployment pipeline and approve for the V1 deployment for production.![](images/oci_app_v1_approval.png)- Once all the stages are completed ,you can see the application is 100 % v1 and data is always persisting.![](images/final_version.png)Acknowledgements------ https://github.com/okteto/go-guestbook- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/Contributors======Author : Rahul M R.Collaborators : Qixuan (Michael) LiLast release : May 2022 Back to examples.----- 🍿 [Back to OCI Devops Deployment sample](./../README.md)- 🏝️ [Back to OCI Devops sample](./../../README.md)
